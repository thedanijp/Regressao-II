Dessa forma, diversas propostas surgem na tentativa de \"balisar\" a quantidade de parâmetros no modelo, como o $R^2$-*ajustado* - que sofre uma penalização por cada parâmetro no modelo e o AIC que vamos discutir adiante.\n",

        "Regularização (ou *model regularization*) é uma forma de considerar a complexidade adicionada ao modelo e simplificar o modelo, quer seja por deixar os parâmetros menos relevantes, quer seja por retirá-los intrgralmente do modelo.\n",
        "\n",
        "As duas formas mais populares na literatura do aprendizado de máquina são a regularização L1 e a regularização L2:\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Função de perda\n",
        "Vamos relembrar que a nossa regressão é uma regressãod e mínimos quadrados, ou seja, estamos minimizando a função do erro quadrático médio (EQM) em função dos parâmetros do modelo ($\\beta_0, \\beta_1, \\beta_2, ..., \\beta_n$). Nossa função de erro, podemos chamá-la de um nome mais geral: *função de perda* L:\n",

        "$$L_1 = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\left( y_i - \\hat{y_i} \\right)^2 + \\alpha \\sum_{k=0}^{M} \\left| \\beta_k \\right|$$\n",

        "#### Regularização L2 (ridge)\n",
        "Outra forma de regularização é a chamada regularização *ridge*, que minimiza a seguinte perda:\n",

        "$$L_2 = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\left( y_i - \\hat{y_i} \\right)^2 + \\alpha \\sum_{k=0}^{M} \\left| \\beta_k \\right|^2$$\n",
